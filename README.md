# Zoom-HRV 

Comparison between the Zoom HRV sensor and a Polar H7 chest strap to determine validity of RR intervals and HRV features extracted from the Zoom HRV wrist based device.

All data are available in the /data folder and were collected using the sensors mentioned above and the HRV Logger app for iOS. Reference data from Polar H7 and HRV4Training data were collected using a custom app that can capture simultaneously both and is not commercially available.

More info on the setup and analysis can be found on the HRV4Training Blog at this link: http://www.hrv4training.com/blog/wrist-based-hrv-analysis-update
